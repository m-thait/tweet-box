MIS credit ratings incorporate all factors that MIS considers material to credit strength, including but not limited to ESG considerations. The CIS provides a clearer view of how material ESG considerations are to a given issuer or transaction, where relevant. A high credit rating does not necessarily imply a positive CIS, nor does a low rating imply a negative CIS.</p>\n<p>In practice, we do observe that our ratings and CIS are correlated but that correlation is not extremely tight for the reasons explained above.</p>\n",
