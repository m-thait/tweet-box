      "Verizon has neutral-to-low exposure to environmental risks. The geographic diversity of the company's telecommunications network limits physical climate risks. Objectives to increase renewable power usage are in line with telecommunications industry trends.",

      "Verizon has moderately negative exposure to social risks. The company's collection of sensitive consumer data and exposure to cyber security risks could negatively impact customer relations.",
    govExposureComments:
      "Verizon has neutral-to-low risk from governance practices. The company operates with a currently moderately aggressive financial policy associated with a recent and sizable debt-funded investment in C-band spectrum licenses, but continues to prioritize a higher investment grade rating target over time. Delays in accessing acquired spectrum and an inability to begin fully deploying related services until late 2023 are factored into our monetization expectations of this strategic investment. Verizon targets accelerating deleveraging over time and benefits from a solid operating track record on guidance historically.",
